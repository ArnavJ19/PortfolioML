# üöÄ Quantifying Market Dynamics: A Data-Driven Portfolio Allocation & Performance Analysis üìä

## Introduction

Financial markets are dynamic ecosystems where macroeconomic shifts, volatility, and sector rotations influence asset performance. Traditional portfolio allocation methods, such as sector-based diversification, often fail to capture the true risk-return relationships between assets.

This project explores a **clustering-driven portfolio construction** methodology, benchmarking its performance against the **S&P 500** and the **Magnificent 7** over the period **2021‚Äì2025**. By leveraging **Hierarchical Clustering** to group stocks based on return-volatility profiles, the strategy seeks to optimize diversification and enhance risk-adjusted returns.

## üî¨ Methodology

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection & Preprocessing
- Historical stock prices from **2021‚Äì2025** were obtained from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) and other market data sources.
- Data cleaning, missing value imputation, and outlier handling were performed to ensure accuracy.
- **Returns and volatility** were computed for each stock to define its risk-return characteristics.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Hierarchical Clustering for Asset Segmentation
- Unlike traditional sector-based allocation, we employed **Hierarchical Clustering** to segment stocks based on their return-volatility profiles.
- The clustering process involved:
  - **Distance Metric**: Euclidean Distance applied to normalized return-volatility vectors.
  - **Linkage Method**: Ward‚Äôs method to minimize intra-cluster variance.
  - **Cluster Selection**: Optimal number of clusters determined using **Dendrogram Analysis**.
- Stocks within each cluster exhibited **similar risk-return characteristics**, ensuring logical diversification.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Momentum-Based Stock Selection
- From each identified cluster, the **top 10 stocks** with the highest cumulative returns over a rolling window were selected.
- This selection ensured momentum-driven exposure across diversified clusters.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Portfolio Construction
- The final portfolio was constructed using **equal-weight allocation**, distributing capital evenly across the selected high-momentum stocks.
- **Equal weighting** was chosen to prevent excessive concentration risk in any single asset.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Backtesting & Performance Analysis
- The strategy was **rigorously backtested** across different market regimes, including the 2022 bear market.
- Performance was benchmarked against:
  - **S&P 500 Index** ‚Äì Representative of broad market performance.
  - **Magnificent 7** ‚Äì A high-growth technology-heavy portfolio.
- Key evaluation metrics included **annualized return, volatility, drawdowns, and risk-adjusted return (Sharpe Ratio).**

## üí° Key Takeaways

### üîπ Clustering-Based Stock Selection Enhances Diversification
- Traditional sector-based allocation does not always reflect true risk-return characteristics.
- **Hierarchical Clustering** ensures assets are grouped based on **actual performance similarities**, improving diversification.

### üîπ Momentum-Driven Selection Works
- Selecting the **top-performing** stocks within each cluster **enhanced returns** while maintaining diversification.
- This **avoids overexposure** to single themes and adapts dynamically to market trends.

### üîπ Equal-Weighting Provides Stability
- Many portfolios overweight large-cap stocks, leading to **concentration risk**.
- **Equal-weight allocation** distributes risk more evenly and reduces over-reliance on a few high-performing stocks.
